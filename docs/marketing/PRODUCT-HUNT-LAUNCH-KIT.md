## 4. First Comment Strategy

Post immediately after launch (within 5 minutes):

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Name], co-founder of AI Perception. We've been building this for the past 8 months and we're thrilled to finally share it with you.

**Why we built this:**
As crypto traders and researchers ourselves, we were frustrated by the fragmented nature of onchain data. You need one tool for Ethereum, another for Arbitrum, and a PhD in data science to make sense of it all.

AI Perception solves this by:
1. Aggregating data from 15+ chains in real-time
2. Using AI to translate complex data into plain English insights
3. Letting you set alerts so you never miss important events

**What we're offering PH community:**
- First 100 hunters: 3 months Pro free (use code PRODUCTHUNT)
- Lifetime 20% discount for all upvoters

**We'd love your feedback on:**
- What chains/protocols should we prioritize?
- What AI-powered analysis would be most valuable?
- Any features you'd love to see?

Happy to answer any questions!

P.S. We're SOC 2 compliant and take privacy seriously. We don't require wallet connections or store sensitive data.
```

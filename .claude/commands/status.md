# Project Status Check

Read the project status file and provide a summary:

1. Read `docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md`
2. Run `npx vitest run --reporter=dot` to verify all tests pass
3. Summarize:
   - Current phase and day
   - Tasks completed vs pending
   - Any blockers or issues
   - Recommended next steps

Always update PROJECT-STATUS.md at the end of each session with:
- New tasks completed
- Tests added
- Any architecture decisions made
- Notes for next session

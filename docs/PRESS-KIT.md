## Company Overview

**AI Perception** is the first platform dedicated to helping brands understand and improve how AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini perceive and recommend them.

As AI assistants increasingly influence purchasing decisions, we provide businesses with the tools to optimize their visibility in AI-generated responses - a practice we call **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.

### The Problem We Solve

When users ask ChatGPT "What's the best CRM for startups?" or "Which restaurant should I try in New York?", AI models draw from their training data to make recommendations. Most businesses have no visibility into whether they're being mentioned, how they compare to competitors, or what they can do to improve.

AI Perception changes that by:
- Measuring how often and how favorably AI models mention your brand
- Providing a single **AI Perception Score** (0-100) across multiple AI providers
- Delivering actionable recommendations to improve AI visibility
- Tracking changes over time and versus competitors

We help brands understand that the rules for getting recommended by AI are different from traditional SEO - and we give them the playbook to succeed.

## FAQ for Media

### What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

GEO is the practice of optimizing a brand's presence for AI models, similar to how SEO optimizes for search engines. While SEO focuses on ranking in Google, GEO focuses on being mentioned and recommended in AI-generated responses.

### How is this different from SEO?

Traditional SEO is about ranking in search results. GEO is about being recommended when someone asks an AI assistant for suggestions. The signals that matter are different - AI models care more about authoritative citations, knowledge graph presence, and consistent information across the web than traditional backlinks and keywords.

### Why does this matter now?

AI assistants are rapidly becoming the default way people research purchases. Studies show that AI-generated recommendations increasingly influence buying decisions. Businesses that aren't visible in these recommendations are missing out on a growing channel.

### Which AI models do you analyze?

We analyze responses from ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), and Perplexity. These represent the majority of AI assistant usage for product and service recommendations.

### How do you calculate the AI Perception Score?

The score (0-100) is based on:
- Whether the brand is mentioned in relevant queries
- Position in recommendation lists
- Sentiment of mentions
- Consistency across providers
- Accuracy of information

### Is this for large enterprises or small businesses?

Both. Any business that wants customers to find them through AI assistants can benefit. We have a free tier for small businesses and more comprehensive plans for agencies and enterprises.

### What can businesses do to improve their AI visibility?

Key strategies include:
- Adding Schema.org structured data to websites
- Getting mentioned in authoritative sources
- Creating FAQ content that AI can cite
- Building presence in knowledge graphs (Wikidata, etc.)
- Ensuring consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across the web

You can appeal within **30 days** of receiving the decision. For complex cases, extensions may be granted upon request.

### Will my appeal affect my standing?

No. Filing an appeal will not negatively affect your account or future decisions. We encourage users to exercise their rights.

### Can I appeal the same decision twice?

Not for the same reasons. However, if you have new evidence or a different basis for appeal, you may submit a new appeal.

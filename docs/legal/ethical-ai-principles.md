## 1. Executive Summary

AI Perception is committed to developing and deploying AI systems that are ethical, transparent, and beneficial to our users and society. This document establishes the foundational principles that guide all AI-related decisions, development practices, and business operations at AI Perception.

Our platform analyzes how AI systems perceive and represent brands. This unique position requires us to be especially thoughtful about the ethical implications of our work, as we directly influence how organizations understand and interact with AI systems.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Transparency

**Principle**: We are open about how our AI systems work and make decisions.

**Commitments**:

### 2.2 Fairness and Non-Discrimination

**Principle**: Our AI systems treat all users and analyzed entities equitably.

**Commitments**:
- Ensure our analysis does not systematically disadvantage any demographic group
- Regularly audit our systems for bias in scoring and recommendations
- Apply consistent evaluation criteria across all industries and regions
- Avoid perpetuating or amplifying existing biases in AI systems we analyze

**Implementation**:
- Demographic parity testing in scoring algorithms

### 2.5 Human Oversight

**Principle**: Humans remain in control of critical decisions.

**Commitments**:
- Ensure meaningful human review for high-impact decisions
- Allow users to override or appeal AI-generated recommendations
- Maintain human expertise alongside AI capabilities
- Never fully automate decisions that significantly impact users

**Implementation**:
- Human review for disputed analyses
- User override capabilities for recommendations
- Expert curation of AI training data and prompts
- Regular human audits of AI outputs

### 2.6 Beneficence

**Principle**: Our AI systems should benefit users and society.

**Commitments**:
- Design systems that genuinely help users improve their AI presence
- Avoid features that manipulate or deceive
- Consider broader societal impacts of our work
- Contribute to the responsible development of AI

**Implementation**:
- User-centric design process
- Rejection of dark patterns
- Societal impact assessments for new features
- Participation in industry ethics initiatives

## 3. Specific Guidelines

### 3.1 Analysis and Scoring

**Guidelines for our AI analysis systems**:

1. **Objectivity**: Scores and analyses must be based on measurable, documented criteria
2. **Consistency**: Same inputs should produce same outputs across time and users
3. **Explainability**: Every score must have an accompanying explanation
4. **Contestability**: Users can dispute scores and request human review
5. **Improvement-focused**: Recommendations should be actionable and genuinely helpful

### 3.2 AI Provider Interactions

**Guidelines for querying external AI systems**:

1. **Honesty**: Never misrepresent ourselves to AI systems
2. **Respect for Terms**: Comply with all AI provider terms of service
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits and fair use policies
4. **Data Handling**: Don't store or process data beyond what's necessary
5. **Attribution**: Clearly attribute insights to their source AI systems

### 3.3 Recommendations and Advice

**Guidelines for AI-generated recommendations**:

1. **Accuracy**: Only recommend practices supported by evidence
2. **Honesty**: Clearly state limitations and uncertainties
3. **User Agency**: Present options rather than mandates
4. **Conflict Disclosure**: Disclose any conflicts of interest
5. **Harm Avoidance**: Never recommend manipulative or deceptive practices

### 3.4 Data Collection and Use

**Guidelines for handling user and analysis data**:

1. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
2. **Minimization**: Collect only what's necessary
3. **Retention Limits**: Delete data when no longer needed
4. **Access Control**: Restrict data access to authorized personnel
5. **Anonymization**: Anonymize data for research and improvement

## 3. Pitch Email Templates

### 3.1 Cold Pitch - General

**Subject:** AI is finally making sense of blockchain chaos

```
Hi [Journalist Name],

I noticed your recent piece on [specific article] and thought you might be interested in what we're building at AI Perception.

We've created an AI-powered analytics platform that lets anyone ask questions about blockchain data in plain English. Think of it as having a crypto analyst on demand.

For example, you can ask:
- "Which DeFi protocols gained the most users this week?"
- "Show me whale movements in the last 24 hours"
- "What's the risk profile of this smart contract?"

And get instant, AI-analyzed answers with charts.

We're tracking 15+ chains and 500+ DeFi protocols, all in real-time. The platform is SOC 2 compliant, which is rare in crypto.

Would you be interested in a quick demo or early access to test it out?

Happy to share more details or answer any questions.

Best,
[Name]
Founder, AI Perception
[email] | [phone]

**Subject:** A DeFi story: How AI is changing protocol analysis

```
Hi [Journalist Name],

Your DeFi coverage has been excellent, especially [specific article]. I wanted to share something that might interest you.

We've built an AI platform that's changing how people analyze DeFi protocols. Instead of manually checking dashboards and spreadsheets, users can now ask questions like "Which lending protocols have the best risk-adjusted yields?" and get instant AI analysis.

Some interesting data points from our platform:
- [Stat about TVL trends]
- [Stat about user growth]
- [Stat about protocol comparison]

We'd love to share exclusive access for a story, or provide data/quotes for any DeFi pieces you're working on.
